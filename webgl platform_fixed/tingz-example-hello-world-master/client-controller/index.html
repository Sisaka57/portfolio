      1. This is an example of importing the Tingz SDK using the umd module 
      
      📝 Note about Tingz SDK import methods:
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      This example uses the Tingz SDK by including the library
      with a classic <script> tag method. For simple apps this can
      sometimes be a great option.

      However, if you are using a bundler we recommend importing 
      tingz-sdk into your project directly. 
      
      For example, React or Vue developers will want to use npm 
      and import the tingz-sdk into your project.

    -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/tingz-sdk@latest/dist/index.umd.js"></script>
    <script>
      // 2. Now we will instantiate the Tingz SDK

      /*
      
        📝 Note about local development environment:
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        When you are developing Tingz apps locally please make sure
        to first start tingz-cli simulator and pass the apiEndpoint 
        and appOrigin options below. 

        Please remember to remove the apiEndpoint and appOrigin before
        submitting to the Tingz app store.
      
      */
      const tingz = new Tingz("hello-world", {
        apiEndpoint: "http://localhost:7778",
        appOrigin: "http://localhost:7777",
      });

      // 3. Receive any incoming events from scene player app
      tingz.receive((data) => {
        console.log("Received data from scene player:", data);
      });

      // 4. Send events to scene player app when your app requires.
      // Send whatever JSON your app requires. Just make sure your
      // scene player app has logic to handle the events you send.
      tingz.send({
        action: "LOADED",
        payload: {
          origin: "client-controller",
        },
      });

      const getUser = () => {
        document.getElementById(
          "user"
        ).textContent = `Howdy ${tingz.user.username} (id: ${tingz.user.id}) 👋!`;
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Client Controller</h1>
    <!-- 
      In this example below we are directly calling tingz.send() 
      and passing JSON object directly to the scene player app 
      when tapping the "Send Timestamp" button.
    -->
    <button onclick="getUser()">👤 Get User</button>
    <button
      onclick="tingz.send({ action: 'UPDATE', payload: {message: 'Hello World!'} })"
    >
      💬 Send <strong>Hello World!</strong> to Scene Player
    </button>
    <button onclick="tingz.send({ action: 'CLEAR' })">🗑️ Clear Scene Player</button>
    <h3 id="user"></h3>
  </body>
